# BPQ_7plus
BPQ Mail 7plus find & decode Linux scripts

find_7p.sh   - finds 7plus in any new messages since it last ran

7p_decode.sh - decodes any parts in the log file created by find_7p.sh

run find_7p before 7p_decode

To get the mail imported, make sure your script matches the BPQMail forward import file definition

You will need the 7plus executable for your distro. I used 7pfbb_200.tgz (https://pc7x.net/archive/mirrors/pi8zaa/linux/fbb/tools/)
